This behavior follows the current behavior of InternApply.\n\nIf InternApply cannot detect any edits made by the user, InternApply\nwill simply copy over the tags from the existing application.\n\nIn doing so, we ensure that InternApply only overrides relevant tags\nthat have been selected for edits by the user.\n\nDue to the changes made, 1 of the test cases in the\n\"EditCommandTest\" class is failing.
